Tasks
#####

Tasks are the fundamental unit of behavior in a DV-Flow specification. Tasks
accept data from tasks that they depend on, and produce data to be used by
dependent tasks. Tasks may have local parameters to control operation.

The implementation of a task is required to perform three key tasks:

* Compute dependencies -- Specifically, determine whether the task must
  perform work. Tasks typically save a 'memento' with the system that
  is used by future evaluations of the task.
* Perform work -- The task implementation must perform the desired
  data transformation when required. Usually this involves invoking
  another tool, such as a compiler. When work is performed, the task
  may produce markers to communicate the location of errors, warnings,
  or other key information.
* Produce output -- Tasks are required to pass data output data
  to their successor tasks independent of whether the task performed
  a data transformation.

Using Tasks
===========

Most tasks are built on top of another existing task or tasks.These
'derived' tasks either modifiy the `parameters` of the base task
to cause it to behave as desired, or compose multiple tasks together
to achieve the desired functionality.

Specifying the Base Task
------------------------
Each defined task has a unique identity. Typically, though, the required 
behavior is very similar to an existing task. As a consequence,
it is very common to define a task in terms of another. This is
done via the `uses` clause.

.. code-block:: yaml
    
    tasks:
    - name: PrintHello
      uses: std.Message

The example above creates a new task named `PrintHello` that
inherits the parameters and implementation of the existing
`std.Message` task. 


Specializing Task Parameters
----------------------------
The simplest way to leverage existing tasks is to customize the
value of parameters that control the behavior of the base task.
Let's take a look at the `std.Message` task. This task displays
a user-specified message string. By default, the message is empty. 

.. code-block:: yaml
    
    tasks:
    - name: PrintHello
      uses: std.Message
      with:
        msg: Hello, World!

The example above creates a new task named `PrintHello` that 
overrides the value of the `msg` parameter. This causes 
the implementation of `std.Message` to print 'Hello, World!'.

Specifying Dependencies
-----------------------
Most tasks operate on data produced by other tasks. The `needs` clause
specifies the tasks that must complete before this task can execute.

.. code-block:: yaml
    
    tasks:
    - name: rtlfiles
      uses: std.FileSet
      with:
        type: "verilogSource"
        base: "rtl"
        include: "*.v"
    - name: sim
      uses: hdlsim.vlt.SimImage
      needs: [rtlfiles]
      with:
        top: [mytop]
    - name: run
      uses: hdlsim.vlt.SimRun
      needs: [sim]

The example above shows three tasks that:

* Gather verilog source files from the `rtl` directory
* Compile the files into a simulation image 
* Run the simulation image

Data passes between each pair of steps above:

* `rtlfiles` outputs a list of sources files required to create a simulation image
* The sim-image task passes a path to the simulation image to the task that runs it

In addition, one step cannot proceed until the proceeding step has completed. These
scheduling and dataflow requirements are captured using `needs` relationships.

Tasks and Dataflow
------------------
Task `needs` relationships specify dataflow between tasks in addition to 
scheduling dependencies. A task provides two controls over what input
data is provided to the task implementation (if present) and what inputs
are forwarded to the output. 

.. image:: imgs/task_dataflow.excalidraw.svg

The two controls are:

* **consumes** - Specifies what input data will be passed to the implementation
  * **all** - All input data is passed to the implementation
  * **none** - No input data is passed to the implementation
  * *pattern* - Inputs matching a pattern are passed to the implementation
* **passthrough** - Specifies what inputs are passed to the task output
  * **all** - All input data is passed to the output
  * **none** - No input data is passed to the output
  * **unused** - Inputs that are not consumed are passed to the output
  * *pattern* - Inputs matching a pattern are passed to the output

The default value of `passthrough` is always **unused**. The default value for the 
`consumes`` parameter depends on the task type:

* **Shell or Python Implementation**: all
* **DataItem or No Implementation**: none

Using Compound Tasks
====================

Compound tasks allow a task to be defined in terms of a set 
of subtasks. In many cases, this allows more-advanced behavior
to be created without the need to provide a programming-language
implementation for the task.

.. code-block:: yaml

    tasks:
    - name: CreateSVFiles
      rundir: inherit
      body:
      - name: mod1
        uses: std.CreateFile
        with:
            filename: mod1.sv
            content: |
                module mod1;
                endmodule
      - name: mod2
        uses: std.CreateFile
        with:
            filename: mod2.sv
            content: |
                module mod2;
                endmodule
      - name: getFiles
        uses: std.FileSet
        passthrough: none
        needs: [mod1, mod2]
        with:
            type: "verilogSource"
            base: "."
            include: "*.sv"

The compound task above uses the `std.CreateFile` task to create 
two SystmeVerilog files. We then want to pass both files on to
all tasks depend on CreateSVFiles. 

This is accomplished by:

* Specifying that all tasks use the same run directory via the
    `rundir: inherit` clause. 
* Causing the `getFiles` to depend on the file-creation tasks
