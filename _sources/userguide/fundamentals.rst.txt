Tasks
#####

Tasks are the fundamental unit of behavior in a DV-Flow specification. Tasks 
typically build on another task -- either in whole or in part.

There are three key concepts of tasks to understand:

* **Task Inputs/Dependencies** - A task may express dependencies on other
  tasks. Doing so has two effects: 

  * A task is executed only after all its dependencies have executed
  * The task receives the union of all output data produced by its dependencies. 

  Executing a task results in outputs that are passed to any task that 
  depends on it.

* **Task Implementation** - A task implementation provides the behavior 
  for a task. It is most common for tasks to be implemented in whole or in
  part by existing tasks. Users can also define their own tasks via several
  mechanisms. (see developer's guide)

* **Task Parameters** - A task may specify a set of parameters that it 
  accepts. Users of that task may modify the parameter values


Let's look at two examples using tasks implemented by the standard library
(ref) to illustrate these concepts.

.. code-block:: YAML

    package:
      name: p1
      tasks:
        - name: SayHello
          uses: std.Message
          with:
            msg: "Hello World!"

The code above specifies a package (named `p1`) that defines a single task
named `SayHello`. The implementation of the task is provided by the 
standard library task `Message` (uses: std.Message). The `Message` task
defines a parameter named `msg`, which specifies the message to display.
Since we want to display "Hello World!", we override the parameter value
in our task.

Running the `p1.SayHello` task will result in the message "Hello World!"
being displayed.

The example above showed the use of parameters, but not dataflow. 

.. code-block:: YAML

    package:
      name: p1
      tasks:
        - name: rtl_files
          uses: std.FileSet
          with:
            base: "src/rtl"
            include: "*.sv"
            type: systemVerilogSource
        - name: sim
          uses: hdlsim.vlt.SimImage
          needs: [rtl_files]

The example above shows simple dataflow. The `std.FileSet` task from the 
standard library produces a `FileSet` parameter based on the specified
user input. In this case, the `FileSet` will contain a list of all 
SystemVerilog source files in the `src/rtl` sub-directory. 

We identify all SystemVerilog source files because we want to compile them
into a simulation image using the Verilator tool. The task `sim` uses the
`hdlsim.vlt.SimImage` task from the `hdlsim` library to compile the source
files. Note how the `sim` task specifies the `rtl_files` task as a 
dependency. This means that it will receive a list of the SystemVerilog 
source files paths identified by the `rtl_files` task.


Packages
########

Packages are used as package namespaces, and to support static configuration.
Built-in packages (eg 'std') are always available. User-defined packages
can be imported explicitly via filesystem path or be discovered via tool-specific
package-path mechanisms.


Dataflow
########

Many build systems coordinate tasks via shared variables. For example, if 
`lib2` has a dependency on `lib1`, then it uses a variable (eg `LIB1_PATH`) 
to reference `lib1`. For reliability, the value of these variables are
typically set from above.

Shared and global data poses a flexility and scalability problem. Using 
global data to configure tools means that it's impossible to use two
different configurations as part of the same workflow. Coordinating via
known paths requires all tasks to share the same filesystem, which
limits where tasks can run, and limits opportunities for caching. 

Consequently, DV-Flow tasks coordinate via parameter sets produced by
a task and consumed by tasks that depend on the producing task.

.. code-block:: YAML

    package:
      name: p1
      tasks:
        - name: rtl_files
          uses: std.FileSet
          with:
            base: "src/rtl"
            include: "*.sv"
            type: systemVerilogSource
        - name: sim
          uses: hdlsim.vlt.SimImage
          needs: [rtl_files]

In many cases, dataflow naturally falls out of the build flow. In the example
above, for example, it's natural to think of the simulation image 'needing'
to have required source files. In cases where the parameter sets represent
controls over tools in the flow, the production is explicit.
